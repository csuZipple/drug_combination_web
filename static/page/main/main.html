            <h1>Drug Combination Database.</h1>
            <p>
                The Drug Combination Database (DrugCombDB) is devoted to the research and development of multi-component drugs. By collecting and organizing known examples of drug combinations, it aims to facilitate in-depth analyses of these cases, to summarize patterns of coordinated drug actions, and to provide a basis for theoretical modeling and simulation of such beneficial drug combinations.
            </p>
            <div class="zl_detail">
                <p>Accumulating scientific and clinical evidences have suggested the use of drug combinations as a safe and effective approach, to treat complicated and refractory diseases. The Drug Combination Database (DrugCombDB) is devoted to the research and development of multi-component drugs. By collecting and organizing known examples of drug combinations, it aims to facilitate in-depth analyses of these cases, to summarize patterns of coordinated drug actions, and to provide a basis for theoretical modeling and simulation of such beneficial drug combinations.</p>
                <p>The current version of DCDB collected 1363 drug combinations (330 approved and 1033 investigational, including 237 unsuccessful usages), involving 904 individual drugs, 805 targets. DrugCombDB provides, for each drug combination, its combined activity/indications, possible mechanism, drug interactions between its components, and current development status; for each individual drug, its chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties, together with its known molecular targets; and for each drug target, its sequence, function annotation and affiliated pathway. Extensive cross-links and external links are available. </p>
                <p>DrugCombDB was created with the support of Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China (Grant No. R207609) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation grant No. 2012M521164. Its maintenance and operational cost is covered by the Maintenance Grant to Provincial Key Laboratory of Biochemistry, Hunan, China.</p>
